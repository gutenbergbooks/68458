  THE LITTLE SALAMANDER
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  TO MARGOT<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When I go free,<br />
  I think 'twill be<br />
  A night of stars and snow,<br />
  And the wild fires of frost shall light<br />
  My footsteps as I go;<br />
  Nobody&mdash;nobody will be there<br />
  With groping touch, or sight,<br />
  To see me in my bush of hair<br />
  Dance burning through the night.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap02"></a>
  THE LINNET<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Upon this leafy bush<br />
  With thorns and roses in it,<br />
  Flutters a thing of light,<br />
  A twittering linnet.<br />
  And all the throbbing world<br />
  Of dew and sun and air<br />
  By this small parcel of life<br />
  Is made more fair;<br />
  As if each bramble-spray<br />
  And mounded gold-wreathed furze,<br />
  Harebell and little thyme,<br />
  Were only hers;<br />
  As if this beauty and grace<br />
  Did to one bird belong,<br />
  And, at a flutter of wing,<br />
  Might vanish in song.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap03"></a>
  THE SUNKEN GARDEN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Speak not&mdash;whisper not;<br />
  Here bloweth thyme and bergamot;<br />
  Softly on the evening hour,<br />
  Secret herbs their spices shower,<br />
  Dark-spiked rosemary and myrrh,<br />
  Lean-stalked, purple lavender;<br />
  Hides within her bosom, too,<br />
  All her sorrows, bitter rue.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Breathe not&mdash;trespass not;<br />
  Of this green and darkling spot,<br />
  Latticed from the moon's beams,<br />
  Perchance a distant dreamer dreams;<br />
  Perchance upon its darkening air,<br />
  The unseen ghosts of children fare,<br />
  Faintly swinging, sway and sweep,<br />
  Like lovely sea-flowers in its deep;<br />
  While, unmoved, to watch and ward,<br />
  'Mid its gloomed and daisied sward,<br />
  Stands with bowed and dewy head<br />
  That one little leaden Lad.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<a id="chap04"></a>
  THE RIDDLERS<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  'Thou solitary!' the Blackbird cried,<br />
  'I, from the happy Wren,<br />
  Linnet and Blackcap, Woodlark, Thrush,<br />
  Perched all upon a sweetbrier bush,<br />
  Have come at cold of midnight-tide<br />
  To ask thee, Why and when<br />
  Grief smote thy heart so thou dost sing<br />
  In solemn hush of evening,<br />
  So sorrowfully, lovelorn Thing&mdash;<br />
  Nay, nay, not sing, but rave, but wail,<br />
  Most melancholic Nightingale?<br />
  Do not the dews of darkness steep<br />
  All pinings of the day in sleep?<br />
  Why, then, when rocked in starry nest<br />
  We mutely couch, secure, at rest,<br />
  Doth thy lone heart delight to make<br />
  Music for sorrow's sake?'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A Moon was there.  So still her beam,<br />
  It seemed the whole world lay a-dream,<br />
  Lulled by the watery sea.<br />
  And from her leafy night-hung nook<br />
  Upon this stranger soft did look<br />
  The Nightingale: sighed he:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  ''Tis strange, my friend; the Kingfisher<br />
  But yestermorn conjured me here<br />
  Out of his green and gold to say<br />
  Why thou, in splendour of the noon,<br />
  Wearest of colour but golden shoon,<br />
  And else dost thee array<br />
  In a most sombre suit of black?<br />
  "Surely," he sighed, "some load of grief,<br />
  Past all our thinking&mdash;and belief&mdash;<br />
  Must weigh upon his back!"<br />
  Do, then, in turn, tell me, If joy<br />
  Thy heart as well as voice employ,<br />
  Why dost thou now, most Sable, shine<br />
  In plumage woefuller far than mine?<br />
  Thy silence is a sadder thing<br />
  Than any dirge I sing!'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thus then these two small birds, perched there,<br />
  Breathed a strange riddle both did share<br />
  Yet neither could expound.<br />
  And we&mdash;who sing but as we can,<br />
  In the small knowledge of a man&mdash;<br />
  Have we an answer found?<br />
  Nay, some are happy whose delight<br />
  Is hid even from themselves from sight;<br />
  And some win peace who spend<br />
  The skill of words to sweeten despair<br />
  Of finding consolation where<br />
  Life has but one dark end;<br />
  Who, in rapt solitude, tell o'er<br />
  A tale, as lovely as forlore,<br />
  Into the midnight air.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap07"></a>
  MOONLIGHT<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The far moon maketh lovers wise<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her pale beauty trembling down,<br />
  Lending curved cheeks, dark lips, dark eyes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strangeness not their own.<br />
  And, though they shut their lids to kiss,<br />
  In starless darkness peace to win,<br />
  Even on that secret world from this<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her twilight enters in.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<a id="chap08"></a>
  THE BLIND BOY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  'I have no master,' said the Blind Boy,<br />
  My mother, "Dame Venus," they do call;<br />
  Cowled in this hood, she sent me begging<br />
  For whate'er in pity may befall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Hard was her visage, me adjuring,&mdash;<br />
  "Have no fond mercy on the kind!<br />
  Here be sharp arrows, bunched in quiver,<br />
  Draw close ere striking&mdash;thou art blind."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'So stand I here, my woes entreating,<br />
  In this dark alley, lest the Moon<br />
  Point with her sparkling my barbed armoury,<br />
  Shine on my silver-laced shoon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh, sir, unkind this Dame to me-ward;<br />
  Of the salt billow was her birth....<br />
  In your sweet charity draw nearer<br />
  The saddest rogue on Earth!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap09"></a>
  THE QUARRY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  You hunted me with all the pack,<br />
  Too blind, too blind, to see<br />
  By no wild hope of force or greed<br />
  Could you make sure of me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And like a phantom through the glades,<br />
  With tender breast aglow,<br />
  The goddess in me laughed to hear<br />
  Your horns a-roving go.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She laughed to think no mortal e'er<br />
  By dint of mortal flesh<br />
  The very Cause that was the Hunt<br />
  One moment could enmesh:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That though with captive limbs I lay,<br />
  Stilled breath and vanquished eyes,<br />
  He that hunts Love with horse and hound<br />
  Hunts out his heart and eyes.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap10"></a>
  MRS. GRUNDY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  'Step very softly, sweet Quiet-foot,<br />
  Stumble not, whisper not, smile not:<br />
  By this dark ivy stoop cheek and brow.<br />
  Still even thy heart!  What seest thou?'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'High-coifed, broad-browed, aged, suave yet grim,<br />
  A large flat face, eyes keenly dim,<br />
  Staring at nothing&mdash;that's me!&mdash;and yet,<br />
  With a hate one could never, no, never forget...'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'This is my world, my garden, my home,<br />
  Hither my father bade mother to come<br />
  And bear me out of the dark into light,<br />
  And happy I was in her tender sight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'And then, thou frail flower, she died and went,<br />
  Forgetting my pitiless banishment,<br />
  And that Old Woman&mdash;an Aunt&mdash;she said,<br />
  Came hither, lodged, fattened, and made her bed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh yes, thou most blessed, from Monday to Sunday<br />
  Has lived on me, preyed on me, Mrs. Grundy:<br />
  Called me, "dear Nephew"; on each of those chairs<br />
  Has gloated in righteousness, heard my prayers.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Why didst thou dare the thorns of the grove,<br />
  Timidest trespasser, huntress of love?<br />
  Now thou hast peeped, and now dost know<br />
  What kind of creature is thine for foe.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Not that she'll tear out thy innocent eyes,<br />
  Poison thy mouth with deviltries.<br />
  Watch thou, wait thou: soon will begin<br />
  The guile of a voice: hark!...' 'Come in, Come in!'<br />

  THE TRYST
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Flee into some forgotten night and be<br />
  Of all dark long my moon-bright company:<br />
  Beyond the rumour even of Paradise come,<br />
  There, out of all remembrance, make our home:<br />
  Seek we some close hid shadow for our lair,<br />
  Hollowed by Noah's mouse beneath the chair<br />
  Wherein the Omnipotent, in slumber bound,<br />
  Nods till the piteous Trump of Judgment sound.<br />
  Perchance Leviathan of the deep sea<br />
  Would lease a lost mermaiden's grot to me,<br />
  There of your beauty we would joyance make&mdash;<br />
  A music wistful for the sea-nymph's sake:<br />
  Haply Elijah, o'er his spokes of fibre,<br />
  Cresting steep Leo, or the heavenly Lyre,<br />
  Spied, tranced in azure of inanest space,<br />
  Some eyrie hostel, meet for human grace,<br />
  Where two might happy be&mdash;just you and I&mdash;<br />
  Lost in the uttermost of Eternity.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Think! in Time's smallest clock's minutest beat<br />
  Might there not rest be found for wandering feet?<br />
  Or, 'twixt the sleep and wake of a Helen's dream,<br />
  Silence wherein to sing love's requiem?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No, no.  Nor earth, nor air, nor fire, nor deep<br />
  Could lull poor mortal longingness asleep.<br />
  Somewhere there Nothing is; and there lost Man<br />
  Shall win what changeless vague of peace he can.<br />

  THE EMPTY HOUSE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  See this house, how dark it is<br />
  Beneath its vast-boughed trees!<br />
  Not one trembling leaflet cries<br />
  To that Watcher in the skies&mdash;<br />
  'Remove, remove thy searching gaze,<br />
  Innocent, of heaven's ways,<br />
  Brood not, Moon, so wildly bright,<br />
  On secrets hidden from sight.'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Secrets,' sighs the night-wind,<br />
  'Vacancy is all I find;<br />
  Every keyhole I have made<br />
  Wail a summons, faint and sad,<br />
  No voice ever answers me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only vacancy.'<br />
  'Once, once...' the cricket shrills,<br />
  And far and near the quiet fills<br />
  With its tiny voice, and then<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush falls again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Mute shadows creeping slow<br />
  Mark how the hours go.<br />
  Every stone is mouldering slow.<br />
  And the least winds that blow<br />
  Some minutest atom shake,<br />
  Some fretting ruin make<br />
  In roof and walls.  How black it is<br />
  Beneath these thick-boughed trees!<br />

  Reverie and dream that memory must<br />

  The starry arches of the skies;<br />
  And 'neath your lightest word shall be<br />
  The thunder of an ebbing sea.<br />

  Come, Death, I'd have a word with thee;<br />

  Ay, music hath small sense,<br />

  They're all at war!&mdash;<br />
  Yes, yes, their bodies go<br />
  'Neath burning sun and icy star<br />

  Dragging cold cannon through a mire<br />
  Of rain and blood and spouting fire,<br />

  Hush! ... I use words<br />

  Which even in noonday cower.<br />
  Heed, heed not what I said<br />
  Of frenzied hosts of men,<br />
  More fools than I,<br />
  On envy, hatred fed,<br />

  Yet, when he smiles, the hand he draws<br />
  Athwart his grinning jaws&mdash;<br />
  Faintly the thin bones rattle, and&mdash;There, there;<br />
  Hearken how my bells in the air<br />
  Drive away care!...<br />

<p class="poem">
  Nay, but a dream I had<br />
  Of a world all mad.<br />

  But that foul Satan-mad,<br />
  Who rots in his own head,<br />
  And counts the dead,<br />
  Not honest one&mdash;and two&mdash;<br />
  But for the ghosts they were,<br />
  Brave, faithful, true,<br />
  When, head in air,<br />
  In Earth's clear green and blue<br />
  Heaven they did share<br />

  There, now!  Death goes&mdash;<br />
  Mayhap I 've wearied him.<br />

  In dreams is hence....<br />
  Come, Love, my lad,<br />
  Nodding that drowsy head,<br />
  'Tis time thy prayers were said!<br />

  Sate in the ages, in his floating ship,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dead calm.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Voices of sea-maids singing<br />
  Wandered across the deep:<br />
  The sailors labouring on their oars<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rowed, as in sleep.<br />

<p class="poem">
  All the high pomp of Asia,<br />
  Charmed by that siren lay,<br />
  Out of their weary and dreaming minds,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded away.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Like a bold boy sate their Captain,<br />
  His glamour withered and gone,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Time, like a falling dew,<br />

  Wings in this mansion of life are coming and going,<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  Coloured with buds of delight the boughs are swaying,<br />
  Beauty walks in the woods, and wherever she rove<br />

  Stir in the deep of her dream, reawaken to love.<br />

  Oh, now begone sullen care&mdash;this light is my seeing;<br />

  High overhead the windless air<br />

  Beside me, too, clear waters coursed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which willow branches, lapsing low,<br />

  I listened; and my heart was dumb<br />

  Longing in vain for him to come<br />

<p class="poem">
  On this fair world, wherein we pass<br />

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
